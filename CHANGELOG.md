**Kernel Version:** Linux 4.19.325

## v1.4 P3 (Hotfix: Lockscreen & Display Stability)
• Resolved Lockscreen HWUI dequeueBuffer ETIMEDOUT (-110) & 480 frames skipped freeze:
  - Reverted experimental SDE plane QoS throttling (`sde_plane.c`) to maintain continuous real-time memory bandwidth for display scanout pipes
  - Restored DRM panel FPS change notifier chain (`sde_kms.c`) so 60Hz ↔ 120Hz refresh rate transitions properly sync with DSI panel timing and WALT scheduler
• Fixed GPU Undervolt & Lockup: Restored official Qualcomm Adreno 650 OPP table with correct RPMh regulator corner voltages
• Fixed Hardware Memory Collision: Removed conflicting ramoops node colliding with QCA6390 WLAN hardware registers
• Guarded KGSL performance switcher with `KGSL_STATE_ACTIVE` check to prevent early boot GMU timeouts
• Clamped schedutil up/down rate limits floor to 500us/1000us to eliminate context-switch clock thrashing
• Defaulted Dynamic Fsync to disabled on early boot for SQLite / SystemUI database integrity

## v1.4 P2
• Unified & Ported all optimizations to Astide Base (Android 14-17 AOSP & MIUI/HyperOS)
• Extreme Gaming Performance Mode Overhaul (WuWa / Heavy Games Edition):
  - Adreno 650 GPU floor frequency locked to 510 MHz (runs only at 510, 587, and 683 MHz OC, eliminating mid-game frame drops)
  - DDR AXI Bus locked high (`force_bus_on = 1`) to eliminate 3D texture & shader streaming hitches
  - Disabled internal Adreno cycle-skipping clock throttling in Performance mode
  - Extended GPU idle timeout to 1000ms for stable inter-frame clock pacing
  - Added CPU Instant Snap Hispeed (`sugov_set_cluster_hispeed`) — snaps to max turbo (1.80/2.42/3.19 GHz) at 35-40% load without relying on Android WALT RTG classification
  - Extended cpufreq down-rate delay to 25ms to maintain peak clock speeds across 60, 90, and 120 FPS frame intervals
  - Bypassed Qualcomm thermal CPU core isolation (`cpu_isolate`) and GPU devfreq throttling in Performance mode — all 8 cores stay active
  - Auto-revive all isolated cores (`sched_unisolate_cpu`) upon activating Performance mode
  - Optimized VFS cache pressure and memory headroom for heavy 4GB+ games
• Added Maple I/O Scheduler (Android flash/UFS 3.1 optimized FIFO scheduler)
• Auto-populated Boeffla Wakelock Blocker on boot (wlan_pno_wl, wlan_extscan_wl, wlan_wow_wl, netmgr_wl)
• Fixed Focaltech 3658u Touchscreen sleep EIO and CRC abnormal logs on screen off/on
• Fixed Aftermarket / KW LCD DC dimming DCS commands and smart FPS fallback
